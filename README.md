# PoolTimer

A Particle project named PoolTimer

### Description
I built a DIY pool heater for our small above ground pool. I have a long hose coiled up in the sun with one end in the pool and the other end connected to a small 12V fountain pump. Another hose leaves the pump, coils up, then exits into the pool. The particle is configured to turn on for 2 minutes then off for 10 minutes, only during the time that sun is actually hitting the coil of hose.

### Improvements
I have additional parts that I will be connecting, mostly for fun. One is a water flow sensor so that I can ensure water is flowing when it should so that I don't burn up the pump. I may be interested in tracking gallons also for fun.

In addition I have some waterproof temperature sensors. I plan to place one in the pool so that I can chart water temperature. I'm going to work on installing a "T" in the hose coil and inserting and sealing a 2nd temperature sensor. Then I can have the Particle monitor the temp in the hose and turn on once it is warm enough, then off when it cools back down rather than an arbirary 10/2 minutes.
